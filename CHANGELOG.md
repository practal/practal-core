# Changelog

## [0.0.9] - 2023-02-11

### Added

- Axioms can have universally quantified premisses now; that is, [axioms can be inference rules now](https://practal.com/press/aair/1/).

### Changed

- Syntax colour schemes for both light and dark modes are based on [*Solarized*](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/) now.

## [0.0.8] - 2023-02-09

This release addresses various issues about syntactic categories.

- The priority relation between syntactic categories is now always a partial order, in particular âªª has been removed.
- ''atomic and ''term are special syntactic categories now that can be accessed explicitly in constraints (but not in syntax specs).
- Syntactic categories can be declared as "loose", which means they are not bounded by ''atomic and ''term a-priori. For non-loose
  syntactic categories S the constraint ''term < S < ''atomic is automatically imposed.
- Abstractions now declare their own syntactic category only if they have a syntax spec that starts with an empty syntactic category specifier.
  If they define their own syntactic category S, then for an abstraction without parameters the constraint ''atomic < S is imposed,
  for abstractions with parameters the constraint ''term < S < ''atomic is added.
